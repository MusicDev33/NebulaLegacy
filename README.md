# NebulaLegacy
This is the old source code from my server on retrosq.com. I figured I'd keep the old code around, and it will actually live on for a bit on my new API.

## Usage
I didn't post the `package.json` file, but the packages I used were fairly minimal, 
and could probably be found just by looking at the app.js file. This repo is really only for educational purposes (how **not** to build
a messenger app), and I won't take any pull requests.
